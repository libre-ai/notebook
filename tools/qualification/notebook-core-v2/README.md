# Notebook Core v2 — qualification-only browser host

This harness is not a product host and must use only the public deterministic fixtures. It builds the
exact locked Rust component, transpiles it to browser-executable ES modules, and runs the closed WIT
API in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit without external requests.

Covered:

- exact backup and Context golden outputs through the real component ABI;
- ten backup refusals plus twelve Context refusals, eight numeric cases, and six replayable resource boundaries;
- static host messages and no plaintext release on every backup refusal;
- strict lowercase 32-hex recovery decoding while invalid 15/17-byte attempts still traverse the component anti-oracle path;
- fresh Web Crypto IDs, salt, nonce, and recovery bytes with an executable uniqueness sample;
- best-effort wiping of host-owned recovery, plaintext, opened plaintext, and Context input buffers;
- ownership transfer to a one-operation worker, closed worker protocol, mandatory termination on success, refusal, startup/clone error, malformed response, trap, OOM, or timeout;
- validated trap copies of each real ABI export, plus real `memory.grow` failure beyond the 512 MiB cap after ABI input copies, across all three operations and browsers;
- a separate, non-shipping `qualification-faults` component that triggers a Rust panic and a real 600 MiB allocator request against the 512 MiB WASM cap on each ABI operation, plus fail-next-allocation points at `serde_json` parsing, JCS output reservation, and Argon2id matrix reservation, in each applicable operation and browser;
- 20 measured iterations after two warm-ups for the locked 16 MiB producer and maximum KDF profiles, including operation and disposable-worker p50/p95, summed linear-memory high-water marks, browser-process-group RSS deltas, and four anti-oracle refusal distributions;
- strict matching of the physical host against the selected 8 GiB constrained, 16–24 GiB mainstream, or 32+ GiB reference class before measurement; every report binds the class bounds and resource-manifest SHA-256;
- browser-resource preflight for secure context, Worker, `ArrayBuffer` transfer, Web Crypto, IndexedDB and at least 512 MiB of available qualification-origin quota; successful component execution proves SIMD128 support;
- an engine-qualified import-free module lifecycle: Firefox compiles once per page and structured-clones into each worker, while Chromium/WebKit compile inside every worker to limit sharing to the engine that requires it; both paths instantiate anew per operation, include compilation in RSS, and account for it in every end-to-end sample;
- indexed byte-for-byte verification of the public 16 MiB `0x5a` open result against its precomputed SHA-256, avoiding both a qualification-only digest copy and WebKit's per-byte iterator allocations; mandatory host termination on every worker outcome;
- required SIMD128 instructions, zero component/core imports and no WASI shim; no storage, logs, telemetry, or external network; the host clock is used only for deadlines and qualification timing;
- generated artifacts and raw measurements confined to ignored `target/notebook-core-v2-qualification/`.

Run with the pinned Bun environment, the manifest-matching Node executable, and locally installed Playwright browsers. Supplying the archive directory additionally verifies all four downloaded archives before execution:

```sh
export NOTEBOOK_QUALIFICATION_NODE=/path/to/node-26.5.0/bin/node
export NOTEBOOK_QUALIFICATION_ARCHIVE_DIR=/path/to/verified-archives
export NOTEBOOK_QUALIFICATION_DEVICE_CLASS=desktop-arm64-high-memory-reference
export NOTEBOOK_QUALIFICATION_EVIDENCE_MODE=physical-evidence
bun run qualify:notebook-core-v2:host
bun run qualify:notebook-core-v2:performance
```

For a real 8 GiB host, select `desktop-arm64-constrained-8gib`; for a real 16 or 24 GiB host, select `desktop-arm64-mainstream-16gib`. The checker refuses a high-memory machine claiming either class. `physical-evidence` also refuses known virtualization signals from `kern.hv_vmm_present`, `hw.model`, or the processor description.

A macOS guest with 8 or 16 GiB assigned is useful for early diagnostics. Inside the guest, use the corresponding device class and run `bun run diagnose:notebook-core-v2:performance:vm`. VM reports carry `evidenceMode: "vm-diagnostic"`, `promotableEvidence: false`, and can only end in `diagnostic-budgets-pass` or `reject`; they can never emit `qualification-budgets-pass`. Detection is defense in depth: an explicit VM mode remains non-promotable even if the guest hides its virtualization. Software throttling, hosted CI and VMs never replace physical evidence.

The public contribution protocol is documented in [`CONTRIBUTING-DEVICE-QUALIFICATION.md`](CONTRIBUTING-DEVICE-QUALIFICATION.md).

`toolchains/notebook-qualification.json` pins the Node and Playwright versions, platform, archive URLs, archive SHA-256 values, installed executable SHA-256 values, browser revisions, and Playwright descriptor hash. `toolchains/notebook-resource-classes.json` defines the hardware ranges, required browser capabilities, 512 MiB product-storage-quota candidate and evidence status. The build also rejects external Rust flags, target overrides, release-profile overrides, wrappers, and target directories; `.cargo/config.toml` and its recorded SHA-256 are the sole SIMD build configuration. The performance summarizer deliberately exits non-zero after writing the complete matrix when any locked budget is exceeded. The 30-minute Playwright test envelope only prevents suite-level false timeouts; every operation retains its 30-second deadline and every anti-oracle attempt its 15-second deadline, while the locked 5/10-second p95 budgets remain unchanged.

The transpiler is the minimal audited `@bytecodealliance/jco-transpile` package, not the full `jco`
CLI: the full package was rejected because its unused componentization dependency reached a critical
archive-extraction advisory. The transpiler is local build tooling under Apache-2.0 with LLVM
exception; the Component Model remains an open boundary and no generated binding is committed.

The Firefox-only compiled module cache is immutable and capability-free; reusing it does not reuse linear memory or an instance. Chromium and WebKit receive no compiled module from the page. Trap and internal-fault campaigns continue to use their dedicated disposable workers and artifacts rather than this performance cache.

The fault harness proves the qualification-host policy and disposable-instance recovery with injected traps, a Rust panic, a real Rust allocator failure at the linear-memory cap, controlled allocation refusal at the `serde_json`/JCS/Argon2id boundaries, and hangs. The `serde_json` failpoint aborts inside the first allocation of an explicit qualification-only owned-string parse. This probe remains necessary because valid production envelopes now deserialize through borrowed strings without heap allocation. The fallible JCS and Argon2id reservations return `resource-limit-exceeded`. It does **not** induce browser-process OOM or prove physical memory erasure. The resource manifest now targets constrained and mainstream arm64 desktops, but only the high-memory reference has archived evidence; the 8 GiB and 16–24 GiB classes remain pending real hardware. The harness checks 512 MiB of available quota on its empty qualification origin, but the real IndexedDB persistence, quota-exhaustion and restore lifecycle still belong to the future product host. Neutral download filenames and all product persistence/UI behavior remain unqualified; this harness is never evidence for a future product host. Gate B remains rejected until the measured budgets, remaining device classes, dependency/process fault evidence, and exact product-host review all pass on immutable commits.
